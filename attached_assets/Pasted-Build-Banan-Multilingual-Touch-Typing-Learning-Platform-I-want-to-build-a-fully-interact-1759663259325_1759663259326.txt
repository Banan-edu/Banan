Build "بَنان (Banan)" – Multilingual Touch Typing Learning Platform
I want to build a fully interactive, multilingual educational platform named بَنان (Banan) (Arabic: بنان) using:

Next.js (frontend + backend via API routes)
Tailwind CSS (styling)
PostgreSQL (database)
JWT + Cookies (authentication/session)
Socket.IO (real-time features)

The platform should support Arabic and English with scalable language architecture.

School Admin – Manages one or more schools.
Billing Admin – Access only to billing features.
Instructor – Manages their school, classes, students, and content.
